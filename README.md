# Programming Languages Semester Project

**Python Text Based Editor**

This project is a simple text-based editor implemented in Python. It consists of two main components:

- **notepad.py**: This file contains the main logic for the text editor, including functions for creating, opening, editing, and saving text files.
- **file.py**: This file handles file operations such as reading from and writing to files, ensuring that data is correctly managed and stored.

The editor provides a basic interface for text manipulation, making it a useful tool for learning about file handling and user interface design in Python.

## Functional Approach

The project employs a functional programming approach to enhance code readability and maintainability. Key features include:

- **Pure Functions**: Functions are designed to avoid side effects, ensuring that they do not alter any state or data outside their scope.
- **Immutability**: Data structures are treated as immutable, reducing the likelihood of bugs caused by unintended modifications.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results are used to create more flexible and reusable code.

By leveraging these functional programming principles, the text editor promotes a clean and modular codebase, making it easier to understand and extend.
